# MySQL project

## Description:
This project is about creating a relational database for a beauty salon management system. The database stores information about services, products, customers, appointments, payments, and employees.
A beauty salon management system is a software application that helps salon owners and staff manage the daily operations of the salon, such as booking appointments, recording payments, tracking inventory, and generating reports.

## Project structure
**Designing the schema**: First we needed to create tables to store the needed information. Then we populated the tables with data to further work through the project.
**Basic queries**: We tried basic queries to work out some data.
**Relationships**: Adding relationships between tables, as well as primary and foreign keys.
**Subqueries**: Writing subqueries to find more specific data.
**Stored procedures and transactions**: Creating stored procedures to make our work easier in the future, getting rid of the need to rewrite chunks of code over and over again. Also, creating transactions for data consistency and integrity by following the ACID properties.
**View**: Creating a view to look up a schedule for an employee for the current day.
